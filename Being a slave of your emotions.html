<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:20.0pt"><strong>Being a slave of your emotions that were formed under false information</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">Not doing the things you "think" you need to do or not doing the things you want to do are two of the primary cause of stress, discouragement, gloom, and sadness. Its adverse effects are much greater than trying and failing, asking and not receiving. Action is its own reward, regardless of the results, while not even committing to your dream will inflate and intensify the urge to live, thus causing more stress on your psyche and creating self-hatred, doubt, and discouragement.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">Then, why do we neglect?</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">We are being a slave of our emotions, of short-term gratitude. Our emotions and short-term gratitudes are formed to manage problems. Yet, we are not very sophisticated to address those problems, and most of them are handled by standard blueprints we learned from society, and the rest are just our reptilian brain. Nevertheless, we can consciously create a life and develop a mindset that can address our problems in a much more sophisticated way, so we can do the mundane and boring things with ease and joy that we initially associate with hardship. We can eat our meal without watching something or going to bed with everything spatially and temporally ready for us to arrive tomorrow. We can spend our nights and weekends improving ourselves and addressing our real issues; instead of turning every meal into a feast, going out, or "chilling" mindlessly. Otherwise, your subconscious will carry the burden that you're postponing the things that will make your life better and that you're neglecting self-care and self-love, which will lead to self-loathing and regrets.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">We can find more and better information to address our problems, needs, and urges [to live]. We can be mindful of them. Then we'll see that as humans, we have all the courage, time, and energy to follow through with our plans. </p>
