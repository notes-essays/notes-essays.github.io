<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:20.0pt"><strong>Being a slave of your emotions that were formed under false information</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">Not doing the things you "think" you need to do or not doing the things you want to do are two of the primary cause of stress, discouragement, gloom, and sadness. Its adverse effects are much greater than trying and failing, asking and not receiving. Action is its own reward, regardless of the results, while not even committing to your dream will inflate and intensify the urge to live, thus causing more stress on your psyche and creating self-hatred, doubt, and discouragement.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">Then, why do we neglect?</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">We are being a slave of our emotions, of short-term gratitude. Our emotions and short-term gratitudes are formed to manage problems. Yet, we are not very sophisticated to address those problems, and most of them are handled by standard blueprints we learned from society, and the rest are just our reptilian brain. Nevertheless, we can consciously create a life and develop a mindset that can address our problems in a much more sophisticated way, so we can do the mundane and boring things with ease and joy that we initially associate with hardship. We can eat our meal without watching something or going to bed with everything spatially and temporally ready for us to arrive tomorrow. We can spend our nights and weekends improving ourselves and addressing our real issues; instead of turning every meal into a feast, going out, or "chilling" mindlessly. Otherwise, your subconscious will carry the burden that you're postponing the things that will make your life better and that you're neglecting self-care and self-love, which will lead to self-loathing and regrets.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">We can find more and better information to address our problems, needs, and urges [to live]. We can be mindful of them. Then we'll see that as humans, we have all the courage, time, and energy to follow through with our plans. </p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">"He who has a why to live for, can bear almost any how" -Nietzsche.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I got "dumped" by someone I loved; that was my first, and I was 34. I stalked her online; that was my first, too. My goal was nothing more than to understand better and comply with my security concerns that I've experienced in the past. I tried to be anonymous and never disturb her, but I blew it ðŸ˜…. I hope I didn't cause her to get annoyed more than she'd enjoyed.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="bottom"><p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I've always been lucky with women, so I didn't have to stay single; and I was also battle-hardened about separations because of my divorce. But that post-breakup was partially harsher than my divorce. Because this time, I was getting to a point where I was acknowledging the true nature of relationships and exploring the idea of removing that illogical concept from my life. Yet, suppose you deprive a mind of something; it will hold on to the most alive memories, just like how it's demonstrated in this music video: <a href="https://bit.ly/3qa2UEY">MGMT - When You Die</a> (there is a valid interpretation of it in the comment I highlighted). Nevertheless, that period allowed me to finally internalize many cold facts and liberating concepts in philosophy, psychology, and especially in neuroscience.</p></div>
