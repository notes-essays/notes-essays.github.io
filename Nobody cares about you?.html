<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:20.0pt"><strong>Nobody cares about you?</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">There is this existentialist suggestion that for a good portion of your life, you think that what you do and say matters, but later in life, you realize that nobody cares about you and they have never done.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;"><strong>Good!</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">But there is a very missing point here:.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">People may think that just because people don't care about them, it means they don't mean anything to them, and they don't matter. This can't be further from the truth. People constantly seek connection with others; validation and stimulation are some of the many reasons for it. We matter because people want to see themselves in us and see that we're here to connect and make them feel not alone, philosophically, physically, and emotionally. So we matter; people care about us as long as they see something for themselves in us. And that's not selfish; it's pretty sweet, actually; because it reveals how we strive to be more together, both concretely and abstractly.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">Go and be yourself. Connect and thus create value because there are people desperately needing your existence.</p>
