<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;"><em>Disclaimer: I was accused of being a "master" manipulator many times (smh), but I'll try to be as honest and open as I could be; after all, this is not much more than a reminiscence. Even though self-censorship annoys me,  I regretfully hid some essential details to prevent "manipulation" allegations.</em> üñï</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I had a moment and ended up writing a long essay. I don&apos;t know if here is the right medium to share, but I wanted to shout it into the &quot;social&quot; void. And since this is &quot;social media&quot;, I&apos;ll share only the socially related bits for your inner monkey&apos;s enjoyment.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">A lot has happened in the last couple of years, and<strong>&nbsp;I&apos;m grateful!</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I experienced being a divorcee. That was the death of my "inner child"; it took me two years to really process that. I'm glad, though, because I discovered that it's not the "inner child" but the "organizing idea" that is the purest source of our individuality, and it can't die; it can only be found and understood better.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I have been a vegan for 3 years and 9 months. I was lean and fit until 23, then I started to gain weight, and last year I hit 230 pounds as a vegan ü§£. But now I am 60 pounds thinner, healthier, and have less gray hair. This happened for no reason other than understanding our unnatural perception of food, and me starting to see food as no more than an energy source.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I got "dumped" by someone I loved; that was my first, and I was 34. I stalked her online; that was my first, too. My goal was nothing more than to understand better and comply with my security concerns that I've experienced in the past. I tried to be anonymous and never disturb her, but I blew it üòÖ. I hope I didn't cause her to get annoyed more than she'd enjoyed.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I've always been lucky with women, so I didn't have to stay single; and I was also battle-hardened about separations because of my divorce. But that post-breakup was partially harsher than my divorce. Because this time, I was getting to a point where I was acknowledging the true nature of relationships and exploring the idea of removing that illogical concept from my life. Yet, suppose you deprive a mind of something; it will hold on to the most alive memories, just like how it's demonstrated in this music video: <a href="https://bit.ly/3qa2UEY" target="_blank">bit.ly/3qa2UEY</a> (there is a valid interpretation of it in the comment I highlighted). Nevertheless, this period allowed me to finally internalize many cold facts and liberating concepts in philosophy, psychology, and especially in neuroscience.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I sued my mother. She has been unlawfully abusing me, my sister, and my father both financially and emotionally since the beginning. Unconditional love [of a mother] has always been something I questioned, anyway. It's one of the strongest shackles preventing us from exploring and figuring out our place and purpose in society and nature. It's also one of the biggest deceptions preventing us from truly loving ourselves and others.</p>
 <p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">My sister got pregnant, and the father is a total turd. Because of her pregnancy, I ended up sheltering their cat, which moans for games all day and drives me crazy. And she won't even take it back üòë. At least she'll raise her child on a plant-based diet, and her doctor is on board, helping her. üòä</p>
 <p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">With zero effort on my part, I found myself in the honeymoon phase of an intimate relationship with a woman. We've known each other for more than six years, but despite both of us having wanted it badly, we could never have gone all the way. It was hot and heavy üòé. But after a while, I realized she didn't share the same romantic understanding and priorities with me. So, I let her go forever.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">It's slightly odd that despite being understanding and fair have always been some of the most important things for me, I was always sexually unloyal in my romantic relationships. I did my studying and finally figured out most of its reasons. Assuming I'll always be an infidel, I thought that sugar relations might be a wise choice. But it quickly became apparent that those were not for me; I didn't find any meaning or satisfaction in them.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">In the light of certain neurological and anthropological knowledge, I accepted how the nature of relationships can be hypocritical, and how sex, even in the most romantic sense, can be just about bestial urges and an animalistic sense of aesthetics. Seeing that I don't have much to learn from another relationship, both romantically and sexually, I tried to see if I'll learn more about myself by allowing my inner animal to explore further. So I let myself go beyond vanilla sex, and got into a couple of kinks.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">At that point, I even had a few women wanting to start a p*rnh*b (PH) or an o*lyf*ns (OF) with me. I was somewhat of a nympho most of my adult life. I was so "disgusting" that there were many periods where having sexual dates 4-5 times a week with different women was just a routine (No, I don't have any STDsüôè). But with the help of some life choices, all the knowledge I've been gathering and developing stayed strong at pulling me to the other side so far. I canceled all the OF and PH plans. I started to refuse sex, even the easy ones ringing my phone at 1 AM and the ones waiting on my sofa. Sometimes, I actually feel irritated when I think of getting intimate with someone just because of the feral urges and foolish tastes of the brain's inferior parts. </p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">But the most important event which triggered this "Amor Fati" moment was that since 2018 this Thursday was the first time when I was able to cry. In the past, my inability to cry was one of the reasons that led me to a 3 years-long anxiety disorder. I was told that I needed to see a psychiatrist. I would, if my problem was the inability to synchronize with society, to hold a job, or to maintain a [healthy] relationship. Back to the incident, I was trying to mediate between two groups of people (in their 30s). Despite all my kind and sincere attempts to understand and assure both sides, they kept being extremely inconsiderate. I had been handling this case for months, but this Thursday, those two parties really went ham on each other, and I was in the middle trying to make peace. After long hours of intense pressure from many people, I asked what would happen if I removed myself from this because they weren't appreciating my efforts, anyway. I saw that they kept going even though I said I was at my limits, so I said I had to leave. I left and broke into tears; I cried loudly for 15 minutes. It terrified me; I thought I won't be able to stop crying üò®. I was not able to cry for years, even when I had bad moments, moments when I felt utter desperation in the face of my failures or injusticeü•∫. I could not cry for those moments worthy crying for, but I cried because of this petty issue. I felt like cheating all those moments, those people, and myself. So, I continued crying in agony at myself, at my "defeats".üò•</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">After 15 minutes, I wasn't getting any calmer; on the contrary, things were intensifying in my mind. But all of a sudden, my mind rendered out this: I'm doing great. I have learned and internalized many complex concepts about myself, my kind, and nature/universe. I know what I want; I know what I need to do. I used to feel like my soul was being ripped apart when I cheated on people I loved, just like Voldemort and his Horcruxes. But I no longer cheat, lie, or even let people believe in me if I can't satisfy their needs. I enjoy the liberty of honesty. I have also been partially successful in reshaping my inferior urges. I was even able to terminate my most enduring FWB relations. I know which road I need to walk to encounter my organizing idea along the way. I'm fine with the fact that even though I have love and understanding in my heart for all the beings of the universe üíñ, staying true to myself and to others can lead me to be perceived as a prick. People think that I ghost or play them, but the truth is I just refuse them in my life. I may really be a prick üòÖ. But I have no worries because I know that nobody has to have anything or anybody to live a fulfilling life. After all, everything in the universe will have everything it requires for its existence. Even if I sink to the bottom or lose some of my most essential social or physical assets, I know everything I'll need to do to fulfill my purpose.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I'm sorry for all the drama and hardship I caused, yet I'm grateful for all the drama and hardship I got challenged with in recent years. Most of us live and die without knowing anything about ourselves. I was "lucky" to learn and experience certain things that helped me get better at figuring out what will lead me to meet my organizing idea, so I can truly be born and live in awareness.</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:14.0pt;">I'm still a Work in Progress, still faulty, and my worst days may be yet to come. But I can't wait the day I will be a valuable Lighthouse for all the lost ships in the void and feel the right to say these:</p>
